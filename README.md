## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Vanilla Javascript

### What I learned

I learned to use JS modules and I tried to aply the knowledge I have about the Model Viel Controller architecture.

I learned about recursions, but at the end I learned how to avoid them, I didn't eliminate all though.

I also learned that I cannot alter files if there is no backend, so I used Local Storage.

### Continued development

I really want to go more in depth into Javascript before going full React, but I will continue my React studies to start warming up. I know this challenge could have been easier or better structured with React, but I wanted to challenge myself into building vanilla.
